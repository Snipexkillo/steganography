## A Program Made For Encoding and Decoding Images/Texts By People Who Are Not Qualified To Create A Program Made For Encoding And Decoding Images/Texts:

Have you ever had the thought: why don't I send my good old pal from freshman year of highschool some cryptid file that they probably never want to see in their life? Well, for those sick psychopaths who want to absolutely terrorize their enemies, this program is your best friend!

The plan is simple: tell them this seemingly innocent image you uploaded into god-knows-what has a message in it! Then fool them into plugging it into this program and viola! You've got yourself a nasty little surprise.

# How Does This Work?
Very simple, my dear watson. We take your seemingly innocent image and put in some magic fairy dust and read it good little midnight stories. We give it some skewed values and yada yada - you've got yourself an encoded image!

Then, we simply check those skewed values and decode it through processes that probably would get us sent to the deepest pits of Hell, and then spit out your message or image.

## IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE OFF.
We aren't wizards after all, we gambled enough with the Pythonian Gods to  get this hunk of junk off the ground, what makes you think we can actually give you a full decompressed image that doesn't look like someone smeared over it with a blur tool off of a photoshop bootleg?
